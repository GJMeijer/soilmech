\title{Get array index of node based on x and y-indices}
\usage{
index_grid2vector(nx, ny, ix = NULL, iy = NULL, i0 = 0, real_only = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{nx, ny}{number of real nodes in x and y-direction}

\item{ix, iy}{scalar of x and y-index. If one of these is left empty
(`NULL`), all array indices in that row or column are returned}

\item{real_only}{if `TRUE`, the grid is assumed to contain only real nodes,
so there are `nx*ny` nodes. If `FALSE`, the grid is assumed to contain
ghost nodes on the sides of each of the four edges of the grid, resulting
in `nx*ny + 2*nx + 2*ny` nodes. These are numbered in row-wise order,
starting with the left-most ghost node underneath the lower edge}
