\arguments{
\item{u}{relative shear displacement, between 0 (no deformation, loose)
and 1 (max deformation, dense)}

\item{width}{width of the sample relative to its height}

\item{n}{number of grains to use over the sample height}

\item{nc}{number of vertices for plotting circles for grains}

\item{crop}{if `TRUE`, only parts of particles that are present within
the element of soil are plotted. If `FALSE`, also the parts of the
particles that are sticking out are plotted}

\item{marg}{plot margins, relative to the height of the soil sample}

\item{color_water}{color for soil particles}

\item{color_soil}{color for water}

\item{size_water}{line thickness for water/soil element}

\item{size_soil}{line thickness for soil particles}

\value{
a ggplot object

\description{
Function returns a plot with a simple shear-deformed element filled
with soil particles, starting off in a loose state and densifying
with deformation
